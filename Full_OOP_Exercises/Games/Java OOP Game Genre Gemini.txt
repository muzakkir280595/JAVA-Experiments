## 💻 Java OOP Game Genre Hierarchy Example

We will create a hierarchy starting with a base `Game` class and then specialized genres like `RPG` and `StrategyGame`.

### 1\. Base Class: `Game`

This **abstract class** defines the common properties and behaviors for *all* games.

**`Game.java`**

```java
/**
 * The base abstract class for all games.
 * Provides common properties and an abstract method for polymorphism.
 */
public abstract class Game {
    // Encapsulation: Attributes are private and accessed via getters/setters
    private String title;
    private int releaseYear;
    private String developer;

    // Constructor
    public Game(String title, int releaseYear, String developer) {
        this.title = title;
        this.releaseYear = releaseYear;
        this.developer = developer;
    }

    // Common non-abstract method
    public void startGame() {
        System.out.println(title + " is starting...");
    }

    // Abstraction/Polymorphism: A method that MUST be implemented by all subclasses,
    // but the implementation details are unique to each genre.
    public abstract void describeCoreMechanic();

    // Getters (and optional setters for mutability)
    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }

    public int getReleaseYear() {
        return releaseYear;
    }

    public String getDeveloper() {
        return developer;
    }

    // Optional: Overriding toString for easy object description
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Game: " + title + " (" + releaseYear + ") by " + developer;
    }
}
```

### 2\. Interface: `Pausable`

This **interface** defines a contract for any game that can be paused. This demonstrates a flexible form of Abstraction and allows for **multiple inheritance of type**.

**`Pausable.java`**

```java
/**
 * An interface for any object that can be paused and resumed.
 * A non-Game class could also implement this!
 */
public interface Pausable {
    void pause();
    void resume();
}
```

### 3\. Subclass: `RPG` (Role-Playing Game)

This class **inherits** from `Game` and **implements** the `Pausable` interface.

**`RPG.java`**

```java
/**
 * A concrete subclass for Role-Playing Games.
 */
public class RPG extends Game implements Pausable {
    private boolean turnBased; // RPG-specific attribute

    public RPG(String title, int releaseYear, String developer, boolean turnBased) {
        // Calls the superclass (Game) constructor
        super(title, releaseYear, developer);
        this.turnBased = turnBased;
    }

    // Polymorphism: Implementing the abstract method from Game
    @Override
    public void describeCoreMechanic() {
        System.out.println("Mechanic: Focuses on character progression, inventory, and " + 
                           (turnBased ? "turn-based combat." : "real-time combat."));
    }

    // Implementing the Pausable interface methods
    @Override
    public void pause() {
        System.out.println(getTitle() + " has been paused. Press 'ESC' to resume.");
    }

    @Override
    public void resume() {
        System.out.println(getTitle() + " is resuming action!");
    }
    
    // RPG-specific method
    public void levelUp() {
        System.out.println("Character in " + getTitle() + " gained a level!");
    }
}
```

### 4\. Subclass: `StrategyGame`

This class **inherits** from `Game` but **does not** implement `Pausable`, showing flexibility in design.

**`StrategyGame.java`**

```java
/**
 * A concrete subclass for Strategy Games.
 */
public class StrategyGame extends Game {
    private String resourceType; // Strategy-specific attribute

    public StrategyGame(String title, int releaseYear, String developer, String resourceType) {
        // Calls the superclass (Game) constructor
        super(title, releaseYear, developer);
        this.resourceType = resourceType;
    }

    // Polymorphism: Implementing the abstract method from Game
    @Override
    public void describeCoreMechanic() {
        System.out.println("Mechanic: Focuses on resource management (" + resourceType + 
                           ") and tactical unit deployment.");
    }
    
    // StrategyGame-specific method
    public void buildBase() {
        System.out.println(getTitle() + ": New base structure deployed.");
    }
}
```

### 5\. Main Application: `GameLauncher`

This class demonstrates how to use the objects and principles of **Polymorphism** and **Abstraction**.

**`GameLauncher.java`**

```java
public class GameLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create objects of the specialized classes
        RPG myRpg = new RPG("Epic Quest 3", 2024, "Studio A", true);
        StrategyGame myStrategy = new StrategyGame("Galactic Empire", 2023, "Dev Team X", "Ore and Gas");

        // --- Polymorphism in Action ---

        // A list of games (using the common Game type)
        Game[] gameLibrary = {myRpg, myStrategy};

        System.out.println("--- 🎮 Game Library Check ---");
        for (Game game : gameLibrary) {
            System.out.println(game); // Uses Game's toString()
            game.startGame(); // Uses Game's common method
            // Uses the method implemented specifically by the subclass (Polymorphism)
            game.describeCoreMechanic(); 
            System.out.println("----------------------------");
        }

        // --- Casting and Interface Use ---

        System.out.println("\n--- ⏸ Pausable Demonstration ---");
        
        // You can check if a Game object is also Pausable
        for (Game game : gameLibrary) {
            // Check the type at runtime: a core OOP concept
            if (game instanceof Pausable) {
                System.out.println(game.getTitle() + " is Pausable!");
                
                // Cast the Game object to the Pausable interface type
                Pausable pausableGame = (Pausable) game;
                pausableGame.pause(); // Calls the RPG's pause implementation
                
            } else {
                System.out.println(game.getTitle() + " cannot be paused.");
            }
        }
        
        // Call a genre-specific method (requires using the specific class type)
        System.out.println("\n--- Calling Specific Methods ---");
        myRpg.levelUp();
        myStrategy.buildBase();
    }
}
```

### Output of `GameLauncher`

```

----------------------------

--- ⏸ Pausable Demonstration ---
Epic Quest 3 is Pausable!

## 🔑 OOP Principles Summary

This example uses all four major OOP concepts:

1.  **Encapsulation:** The attributes (`title`, `releaseYear`, `developer`, `turnBased`, `resourceType`) are `private` and accessed only through public methods (`getTitle()`, etc.), protecting the object's state.
2.  **Inheritance:** `RPG` and `StrategyGame` *inherit* from the `Game` class, reusing the `startGame()` method and the common attributes.
3.  **Abstraction:** The `Game` class is `abstract` and forces subclasses to implement `describeCoreMechanic()`. The `Pausable` interface is a pure form of abstraction (a contract).
4.  **Polymorphism:**
      * The `describeCoreMechanic()` method behaves differently in `RPG` and `StrategyGame`, despite being called through a `Game` reference.
      * The `Game[]` array holds objects of different types (`RPG`, `StrategyGame`) that are treated as the common base type (`Game`).
