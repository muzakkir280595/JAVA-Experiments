The reason you put `this.platform = platform;` in the derived class constructor is to **assign the value of the parameter to the class's field (or instance variable).**

This is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) when creating a new object.

Here is a breakdown of why this line is necessary, based on the `VideoGame` class example:

## 🔑 Breakdown of `this.platform = platform;`

### 1\. The Instance Field (`this.platform`)

  * **`this.platform`** refers to the private field named `platform` that belongs to the specific object (instance) you are currently creating. It holds the state of the object (e.g., "PC", "PlayStation 5").
    ```java
    public class VideoGame extends Game {
        private String platform; // This is the instance field (this.platform)
        // ...
    }
    ```

### 2\. The Local Parameter (`platform`)

  * **`platform`** (without `this.`) refers to the local variable passed into the constructor when the object is created. This variable only exists temporarily inside the constructor method.
    ```java
    public VideoGame(String title, String platform) { // This is the local parameter (platform)
        // ...
    }
    ```

### 3\. The Assignment

  * **`this.platform = platform;`** copies the value from the local parameter (e.g., `"PC"`) and stores it permanently into the object's instance field (`this.platform`).

**In simple terms:** You are taking the information the user gave you (the value in the parameter) and saving it inside the object so the object can use it later. If you omitted this line, the object's `platform` field would remain uninitialized (or `null`), and the object wouldn't know what platform it's supposed to be on.

### The Role of `this`

The `this` keyword is crucial when the instance field (`platform`) has the **exact same name** as the constructor parameter (`platform`).

  * If you just wrote `platform = platform;`, the compiler would assume you are assigning the parameter to **itself**, and the instance field would never get the correct value.
  * **`this.`** explicitly tells the compiler: "I am referring to the **object's field** on the left side, and the **parameter** on the right side."
